This directory contains the src code and binary compilations of a point group finding code which also prints the multiplication table, and a factor group findng code.

To compile the point group code please type:
./bash compile.sh

To test the code run in the terminal:
./point_group /PATH/TO/POSCAR

to write output to a file:
./point_group /PATH/TO/POSCAR/ >ouput.filename

To compile the factor group code first comment out the two include lines noted at the top of the io_func.cpp file. Then execute:
./bash factor_group_compile.s

To test code run in terminal:
./find_factor_group /PATH/TO/POSCAR 

To write output to file:
./find_factor_group /PATH/TO/POSCAR >output.filename

Output file from several example POSCARS can be found in the point_group_results and factor_group_results directories respectively.
